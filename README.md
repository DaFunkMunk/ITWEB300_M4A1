Using JQuery to Interact with HTML Controls

Purpose

There are often multiple ways to solve programming problems such as accessing and working with HTML controls.  Among other possible solutions, you can use JQuery for this work.  In this assignment, you will be using JQuery to interact with HTML Controls.

Assignment Instructions

One of the joys of being a programmer is when the requirements change.  As a JavaScript programmer for Jscript, Inc., you have been working on a project to create an IT support ticket Web site.  You have written a substantial amount of code for the functionality of the site, including some work using JavaScript and the HTML DOM.  The project leader has decided JQuery would be a better approach for this functionality.

Following are the requirements for your JavaScript coding.  For each requirement, you will prepare a short description of the code you will write and prepare an example of how the code will look in the HTML for the page.  Prepare any required element or tag names for your code and document them appropriately.  Your code must use JQuery, and you need only to prepare the code for the JQuery interaction with the page, not other support functionality that would lead up to the requirements.

When the user logs into their support account, use a hidden element on the page to display “Hello” + the name of the user.
If the user’s attempt to log in is incorrect, display an error message without reloading the page, and clear the id and password fields.
Depending on the type of support ticket selected from a dropdown list, (computer, software, network), display different form fields.
Write one more useful example of the use of JavaScript with JQuery for this site. Describe the purpose and the action, and prepare an example of the JavaScript in the HTML code.
Submission Requirements

Submit the following documents:  

Upload to a new repository on your GitHub:
All pages and supporting files, including all source code.  
Invite your instructor to your new repository. (See classroom for your instructor’s GitHub name.)
Submit to the classroom a document with the following contents:
Your GitHub name and the repository name for this project.
Descriptions of each example, and the HMTL and JavaScript example code to demonstrate your functionality.  
A 1-2 paragraph discussion of your experience with the assignment and issues you faced.  

Working on this assignment gave me a deeper appreciation for how jQuery simplifies common JavaScript tasks such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic form updates. 
Transitioning from plain JavaScript to jQuery allowed for much cleaner and more readable code. Features like .on(), .val(), .text(), and class toggling with .addClass() and 
.removeClass() made it easier to build a responsive and user-friendly interface for the IT support ticket system.

One of the minor challenges I encountered was ensuring that all hidden or dynamically updated elements (like dropdowns and error messages) responded correctly under different 
scenarios, such as failed logins or ticket-type switching. Managing when to show/hide content without reloading the page required careful attention to element IDs and class 
usage. However, once the core pattern was established, it was straightforward to replicate and extend across other features. Overall, the assignment was a solid exercise in 
practical jQuery usage.
